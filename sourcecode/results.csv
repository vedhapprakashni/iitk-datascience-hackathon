95,1,"The backstory does not contradict any events or character traits in the novel, and the supporting evidence suggests that Noirtier's actions and relationships are plausible within the context of the story. Although some claims lack direct evidence, there are no major contradictions that would render the backstory inconsistent."
136,1,"The evidence analysis reveals no major contradictions and only neutral or supporting verdicts, indicating that the backstory does not contradict the novel, and the lack of information about Faria's life on the island and his work on human intelligence does not necessarily imply inconsistency."
59,0,"The backstory is inconsistent due to a major contradiction regarding Thalcave's actions after escaping captivity, as the excerpts describe him disappearing in a plain or flooded area, not returning to the mountains. This contradiction outweighs the supporting evidence and minor issues, making the backstory inconsistent with the novel."
